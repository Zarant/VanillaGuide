Overview
============
* This is a rough port of my own leveling guide into the VanillaGuide framework for Vanilla WoW (1.12)

* You can install [Guide Creator](https://github.com/Zarant/GuideCreator/tree/classic) to enable automatic step completion

* I highly recommend using this with [TomTom](https://github.com/cralor/TomTomVanilla) to generate accurate waypoints

* I only imported my Night Elf Hunter route so far, this is an experimental version it's full of bugs and stuff to do

* Since I don't play this version of the game anymore, don't expect any updates

* If you want to convert more guidelime guides yourself, check out the [VGuideExport](https://github.com/Zarant/Guidelime_Zarant/blob/e48fb1bbc00e9632edb005510fa76970e85a72d7/Guidelime_Zarant.lua#L1158) branch
